        <!-- Colour Scheme -->
         <h3>Colour scheme</h3>
        <p>The website i developed has a simple yet effective design scheme such as the use of a dark colour scheme
            which utilises colours such as black and grey backgrounds with white text to be easily read by users and
            also including yellow for some nice contrast with the rest of the colours, the inspiration for this colour
            scheme came from coolors.co which generates random colour schemes.
            <!-- navigation bar -->
            <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
            The Navigation bar consists of 4 navigation links to move around the site these are positioned on the top
            right of the screen. The Logo instead is positioned to the top left side of the screen at all times, this
            splits the logo from the navigation links making it stand out more and makes it easier to remember as it's
            clearly visible. When displaying the website on a mobile device the navigation links are hidden in a
            hamburger menu in the top right of the screen in order to reduce the amount of content blocking the screen.
            <!-- Index Page -->
            <h3>Index Page</h3>
            The index page includes a short animation that types out my opening line, it's good as it's not overly
            flashy and gets to the point while still keeping the users interest. Also on the index page is the button to
            be able to ge to this report it is coloured yellow to make it clearly stand out on the page. </p>

        <h2>04.Website development</h2>
        <p>The development of the website started off with just creating basic website templates consisting of just text
            with no styling,this was done with easily and without errors. After that I began to work on the css styling
            for each page individually this is where problems began to arise, things such as the breaking point of the
            website not functioning correctly causing css styling to dissapear completely if the window was at certain
            resolutions or having a class for certain elements in the page that would only work in one of the three
            resolutions but not the other therefore neeeding seperate classes for each resolution. Sometimes having
            fixed one issue would end up causing another issue somewhere else. Most of the issues were fixed by using
            the inspect element feature on the web browser so i could actively change it and see if the problem was
            fixed before writing the code in the editor </p>
